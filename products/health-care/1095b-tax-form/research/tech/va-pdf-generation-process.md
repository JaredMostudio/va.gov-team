# A Breakdown of the Current VA PDF Generation Process
## Filling out the Form
### Background
Inside vets-api repo, there is a [pdf_fill](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/tree/master/lib/pdf_fill) library folder which contains Ruby scripts and all the empty VA forms which are filled programmatically with the scripts. VA pdf-fill scripts run on [pdf-forms](https://github.com/jkraemer/pdf-forms) (Gem file), which in turns uses [pdftk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/) 

Since it is currently actively being used in the vets-api repository, we should not need to get approval for new tools/systems.

## Validating the Form
### Background
Forms on VA.gov use JSON schema to define a common contract for data validation between the front end and back end. Schemas are kept in [vets-json-schema](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-json-schema) repo.

Since **1095B is an IRS form** and **NOT** a VA form, it may not be required that we use the same method. However, it may be the path of least resistance. We need a way to validate the data in the form and following the existing standard _should_ simplify things and _could_ make maintenance easier.
